/**
A switch statement, as shown in Figure 2.4, is a complex decision-making structure
in which a single value is evaluated and flow is redirected to the first matching branch,
known as a case statement. If no such case statement is found that matches the value, an
optional default statement will be called. If no such default option is available, the entire
switch statement will be skipped.
