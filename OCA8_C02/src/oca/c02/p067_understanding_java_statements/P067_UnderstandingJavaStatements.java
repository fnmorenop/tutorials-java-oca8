/**
Java operators allow you to create a lot of complex expressions, but theyâ€™re limited in the
manner in which they can control program flow. For example, imagine you want a section
of code to only be executed under certain conditions that cannot be evaluated until
runtime. Or suppose you want a particular segment of code to repeat once for every item in
some list.

As you may recall from Chapter 1, a Java statement is a complete unit of execution in
Java, terminated with a semicolon (;). For the remainder of the chapter, we'll be introducing
you to various Java control flow statements. Control flow statements break up the flow
of execution by using decision making, looping, and branching, allowing the application to
selectively execute particular segments of code.

These statements can be applied to single expressions as well as a block of Java code.
As described in the previous chapter, a block of code in Java is a group of zero or more
statements between balanced braces, ({}), and can be used anywhere a single statement is
allowed.
