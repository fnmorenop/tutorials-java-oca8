/**
Now that you can build applications with simple while and do-while statements, we
expand our discussion of loops to a more complex repetition control structure called a for
loop.

Starting in Java 5.0, there are now two types of for statements. The first is referred to as
the basic for loop, and the second is often called the enhanced for loop. For clarity, we'll
refer to the enhanced for loop as the for-each statement throughout the book.
