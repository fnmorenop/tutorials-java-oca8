/**
Be able to write code that uses Java operators. This chapter covered a wide variety of
operator symbols. Go back and review them several times so that you are familiar with
them throughout the rest of the book.

Be able to recognize which operators are associated with which data types. Some operators
may be applied only to numeric primitives, some only to boolean values, and some
only to objects. It is important that you notice when an operator and operand(s) are mismatched,
as this issue is likely to come up in a couple of exam questions.

Understand Java operator precedence. Most Java operators you'll work with are binary,
but the number of expressions is often greater than two. Therefore, you must understand
the order in which Java will evaluate each operator symbol.

Be able to write code that uses parentheses to override operator precedence. You can use
parentheses in your code to manually change the order of precedence.

Understand if and switch decision control statements. The if-then and switch statements
come up frequently throughout the exam in questions unrelated to decision control,
so make sure you fully understand these basic building blocks of Java.

Understand loop statements. Know the syntactical structure of all loops, including while,
do-while, and for. Each loop has its own special properties and structures. Also, be familiar
with the enhanced for-each loops that iterate over lists.

Understand how break and continue can change flow control. Know how to change the
flow control within a statement by applying a break or continue command. Also know
which control statements can accept break statements and which can accept continue
statements. Finally, understand how these statements work inside embedded loops or
switch statements.
